# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

# Objective

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset (train.csv) to understand the structure, trends, relationships, and distributions within the data. The insights gained will help in identifying data quality issues, potential patterns, and factors that might be useful for further predictive modeling.

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib
Seaborn

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

# Visualizations

Histograms – Distribution of numeric data.

Boxplots – Detection of outliers.

Heatmap – Correlation matrix.

Pairplot – Bivariate analysis of feature relationships.


# Conclusion

This EDA provides a strong foundation for feature selection, data cleaning, and future machine learning modeling. It helps understand which features are influential, how they interact, and where data preprocessing is required.
